## Creating a Python virtual enviroment to run the scripts
_python2.7 already installed on your system_
> Python2.7 already installed on your system
### python2.7 already installed on your system

If you have `virtualenv` installed, you can configure an isoleted Python enviroment to run the scripts of the repository.

En caso de no tener el paquete de `virtualenv` instalado, y/o tampoco la versión de `python` necesaria para que exista compatibilidad, seguir los pasos detallados en [Installing Python and virtualenv](https://github.com/ntrivisonno/testing_README/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#installing-python-and-virtualenv-libraries-python27-not-installed-in-your-system)

Also the repository provides a `requirements.txt` file to facilitate the installation of the dependencies.

First, you need to create a directory to contain your virtual environments and then create one for this project:

```
~$ mkdir virtualenvs
~$ cd virtualenvs
~/virtualenvs$ virtualenv --python=python2.7 dzhanibekovEffect
```

Note that the virtual enviroment is created using `python2.7` ensuaring the compatibility with the scripts.

Once the virtual enviroment is created, it needs to be activated:

`~/virtualenvs$ source dzhanibekovEffect/bin/activate`

The name of the current virtual environment will now appear on the left of the prompt to let you know that it’s active. From now on, any package that you install using pip will be placed in the `dzhanibekovEffect` folder, isolated from the global Python installation.

We need to make sure that the pip version contained in the virtual environment is up to date

`$ pip install -u pip`

Now download the file `requirements.txt` and the `*.py` scripts and place them in the current folder. Then, we can install the required dependencies:

`~/virtualenvs$ pip install -r requirements.txt`

The main script is `test.py` and to execute it

`$python test.py`

Poner como se dá cuenta que termina OK

Once you are done working in the virtual environment for the moment, you can deactivate it:

`$ deactivate`

Now running python will just use the system’s default Python interpreter, which is not modified by anything done while being inside the virtual environment.

To delete a virtual environment, just delete the corresponding folder. (In this case, it would be `~$rm -r dzhanibekovEffect`).

## Installing Python and virtualenv libraries _Python2.7 not installed in your system_

This instructions are if you don't have `python2.7` installed on the system, so first you have to download `python2.7` package, followed by the `virtualenv` library and then continue with the step show in [Creating a Python virtual enviroment](https://github.com/ntrivisonno/testing_README/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#creating-a-python-virtual-enviroment-to-run-the-scripts-python27-already-installed-on-your-system)
